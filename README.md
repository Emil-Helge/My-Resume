# My personal resume

I have created a resume for myself that presents relevant information about me that is intended to be used in the future when applying for internships.

In addition to the information about myself, I have carefully styled the page to be both responsive and with a rather minimalistic and clean design with a touch of **Javascript** to create flow and interactivity.

During this project I have also gained experience working with **Tailwind CSS** for the first time.

My resume is still a work in progress and will be updated with further adjustments as I gain additional experience during my studies.
